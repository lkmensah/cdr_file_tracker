# Application Guidelines

This document provides a summary of the application's features and guidelines on how to use them effectively.

## 1. Dashboard

The Dashboard is the landing page and provides a high-level overview of your work.

- **Statistics:** At the top, you'll find quick-glance cards showing the total number of Files, Incoming Mail items, and Court Processes in the system.
- **Files Overview Chart:** A bar chart displays the number of new files created each month for the current year, broken down by category. This chart automatically resets every year.

## 2. Managing Files

The "Files" page is where you manage your primary case files.

- **Create a New File:** Use the "New File" button to open a dialog where you can enter the file number, subject, category, and other details.
- **View File Details:** Click the "View Details" option in the action menu for any file to see all its associated correspondence and movement history in a pop-up dialog.
- **Add Correspondence:** From the action menu on a file, select "Add Correspondence" to log new items (like outgoing mail, memos, or filings) directly into that file.
- **Move a File:** Select "Move File" from the action menu to log the physical movement of a file. This is crucial for tracking its location and status.
- **Expand to See Letters:** Click the arrow icon on the left of any file row to quickly see a summary of all letters contained within it without opening the full details view.

## 3. Handling Correspondence

The app has dedicated sections for logging correspondence before it's assigned to a file.

- **Incoming Mail:** Go to the "Incoming Mail" page to log new letters or documents received. They will appear in the table on this page.
- **Court Processes:** Use the "Court Processes" page to log new legal documents from the court.
- **Assigning to a File:** Once an item is logged in either of these sections, use the "Assign to File" button to attach it to the correct case file. After assignment, it will be removed from the general list and will only appear within the details of the assigned file.

## 4. Archives

When a file is closed, you can record its archival information.

- **Go to the "Archives" page** to view all archived records.
- **Create an Archive Record:** Use the "New Archive" button to log details like the box number, file number, and date range.

## 5. File Census

The "Census" page helps you maintain a registry of active files and their assigned attorneys.

- **Create a Census Record:** Go to the "Census" page and use the "New Record" button to log which attorney is responsible for a specific file.

## 6. Reporting

The "Report" page allows you to generate detailed summaries of your files.

- **Generate a Report:** Choose a time period (All Time, Monthly, or Quarterly) and click "Generate Report".
- **View Summary & Details:** The report provides a summary of files by category and status (In Progress vs. Completed). You can expand each category to see a detailed list of the files.
- **Export:** You can export any generated report to either **PDF** or **CSV** format using the download buttons.

## 7. Global Search

Use the "Global Search" page to find any record across the entire system.

- Simply type your search term (e.g., a file number, subject, person's name, document number) and the system will look through all files, letters, archives, and census records.

## 8. Audit Log

The "Audit Log" provides a chronological history of all actions taken by users in the application. This is useful for tracking changes and maintaining accountability. The log is read-only and cannot be altered.
